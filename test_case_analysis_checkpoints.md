- [ ] **Template Consistency**: Correct template used (step-by-step vs. final result)?
- [ ] **Clear Expectations**: Expected results are specific and measurable?
- [ ] **Visual Support**: Images provided for complex UI validations?
- [ ] **Annotation Quality**: Arrows/highlights clearly indicate validation points?
- [ ] **Complete Coverage**: All important changes/states validated?

## Technical Quality Checkpoints

### ☐ Automation Readiness
- [ ] **Unambiguous Steps**: No interpretation required for any step?
- [ ] **Technical Feasibility**: All actions can be automated?
- [ ] **Data Availability**: Test data is obtainable programmatically?
- [ ] **Environment Compatibility**: Works across target test environments?
- [ ] **Stable Selectors**: UI elements can be reliably identified?

### ☐ Platform Considerations
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Awareness**: Platform-specific behaviors documented?
- [ ] **Device Limitations**: Hardware/software constraints considered?
- [ ] **Performance Implications**: Time-sensitive operations properly handled?
- [ ] **Network Dependencies**: Connectivity requirements specified?
- [ ] **Version Compatibility**: OS/app version requirements clear?

### ☐ Data and Security
- [ ] **Data Privacy**: Test data doesn't expose sensitive information?
- [ ] **Data Cleanup**: Test execution doesn't leave persistent changes?
- [ ] **Permission Requirements**: Required permissions explicitly stated?
- [ ] **Authentication**: Login/security requirements properly handled?
- [ ] **Test Data Management**: Clear data setup and teardown procedures?

## Quality Assurance Checkpoints

### ☐ Language and Clarity
- [ ] **Professional Language**: Proper grammar and spelling throughout?
- [ ] **Consistent Terminology**: Same terms used consistently across test case?
- [ ] **Clear Instructions**: No ambiguous phrases like "verify", "check", "ensure"?
- [ ] **Specific Actions**: Actions use precise UI element descriptions?
- [ ] **Measurable Results**: Expected results use quantifiable criteria?

### ☐ Completeness Validation
- [ ] **End-to-End Coverage**: Full user scenario covered from start to finish?
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Appropriate boundary conditions tested?
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Invalid inputs and error scenarios considered?
- [ ] **Recovery Paths**: User can recover from failures?
- [ ] **Alternative Flows**: Multiple paths to same goal considered?

### ☐ Maintenance Considerations
- [ ] **Update Frequency**: How often will this test case need updates?
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: External dependencies tracked and manageable?
- [ ] **Documentation Links**: References remain valid over time?
- [ ] **Version Control**: Changes tracked and reasoned?
- [ ] **Knowledge Transfer**: Test case comprehensible to other team members?

## Red Flag Detection

### ☐ Critical Issues
- [ ] **No Red Flags**: Check for these critical problems:
  - Missing preconditions
  - Vague or ambiguous steps
  - Assumption-based instructions
  - Missing expected results
  - Multiple scenarios in one test case
  - Broken reference links
  - Platform-agnostic approach where platform matters
  - Unclear test data requirements

### ☐ Automation Blockers
- [ ] **No Automation Issues**: Check for automation-preventing problems:
  - Steps requiring human judgment
  - Non-deterministic outcomes
  - Manual verification requirements
  - External system dependencies not automatable
  - Time-dependent operations without proper waits

## Analysis Completion

### ☐ Final Review
- [ ] **Random Person Test**: Could a complete stranger execute this test case successfully?
- [ ] **Value Assessment**: Does this test case add meaningful coverage?
- [ ] **Duplication Check**: Is this test case unique in the test suite?
- [ ] **Priority Alignment**: Does test case priority match its business importance?
- [ ] **Ready for Implementation**: Test case is ready for manual execution and/or automation?

## Scoring Criteria

**Excellent (90-100%)**: All checkpoints passed, ready for automation
**Good (80-89%)**: Minor issues, ready for manual execution, automation with small fixes
**Needs Improvement (60-79%)**: Several issues, requires revision before execution  
**Poor (<60%)**: Major issues, requires complete rewrite

## Post-Analysis Actions

Based on checkpoint results:
- **Pass**: Mark as reviewed and ready for execution
- **Minor Issues**: Document specific improvements needed
- **Major Issues**: Return to author with detailed feedback
- **Automation Notes**: Document automation-specific considerations
- **Follow-up Required**: Schedule review after improvements implemented
