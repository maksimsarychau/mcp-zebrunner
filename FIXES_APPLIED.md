# Fixes Applied to Zebrunner MCP Server

## Summary
This document outlines the fixes applied to improve reliability, performance, and maintainability of the Zebrunner MCP server.

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Connection Health Check Fix
**File:** `src/api/enhanced-client.ts:230-290`
**Issue:** Connection test was failing with hardcoded "TEST" project key
**Solution:**
- Implemented fallback connection testing strategy
- Added graceful handling of 400/404 responses as positive indicators
- Enhanced error reporting with detailed connection status

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Input Validation
**File:** `src/api/enhanced-client.ts:116-195`
**Issue:** Insufficient parameter validation leading to runtime errors
**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive validation for all input parameters
- Type checking for numeric IDs, string formats, and date parameters
- Better error messages with specific format requirements
- Added bounds checking for query length and pagination parameters

### 3. ✅ Memory Management Improvements
**File:** `src/api/enhanced-client.ts:382-444`
**Issue:** Potential memory leaks with large paginated datasets
**Solution:**
- Added `maxResults` parameter to limit data collection
- Implemented progress callbacks for monitoring large operations
- Added respectful API delays during bulk operations
- Better logging for pagination operations

### 4. ✅ Type Safety Enhancements
**File:** `src/utils/hierarchy.ts:160-229`
**Issue:** Use of `any` types compromising type safety
**Solution:**
- Replaced `any` types with proper `ZebrunnerTestSuite` types
- Added circular reference detection in hierarchy processing
- Enhanced error handling with input validation
- Improved null/undefined checks

### 5. ✅ Package Configuration Cleanup
**File:** `package.json:7-22`
**Issue:** Multiple confusing entry points and scripts
**Solution:**
- Consolidated to single production server entry point
- Removed legacy and experimental script variations
- Added lint and clean scripts for better development workflow
- Simplified script naming for clarity

## Additional Improvements

### Error Handling
- Standardized error types across all modules
- Better error messages with actionable suggestions
- Graceful degradation for experimental features

### Performance Optimizations
- Added request debouncing for bulk operations
- Implemented proper pagination limits
- Memory-conscious data processing

### Code Quality
- Removed duplicate implementations
- Improved type definitions
- Enhanced documentation and comments

## Testing Impact
- All existing tests should pass
- Health check now properly validates connection
- Integration tests more reliable with better error handling

## Breaking Changes
None of the fixes introduce breaking changes to the public API. All changes are backward compatible.

## Migration Notes
1. Update any scripts referencing old npm script names
2. Existing .env files continue to work unchanged
3. All MCP tool interfaces remain the same

## Verification Steps
Run these commands to verify fixes:
```bash
npm run build      # Should compile without errors
npm run lint       # Type checking should pass
npm run test:health # Connection test should work better
npm test           # All tests should pass
```

### 6. ✅ Server Implementation Improvements
**File:** `src/server.ts:63-98, 100-106, 149-154, 306-333, 367-376`
**Issue:** Type safety issues and inefficient error handling in main server
**Solution:**
- Improved debug logging with safe JSON serialization
- Enhanced error handling with proper type guards
- Better input validation for required parameters
- More efficient Promise handling for bulk operations
- Added proper type annotations replacing `any` types
- Improved experimental feature error reporting

## Files Modified
- `src/api/enhanced-client.ts` - Connection testing, validation, memory management
- `src/utils/hierarchy.ts` - Type safety and circular reference protection
- `src/server.ts` - Main server type safety and error handling improvements
- `package.json` - Script consolidation and cleanup
- `FIXES_APPLIED.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps
1. Consider implementing rate limiting for production use
2. Add comprehensive logging configuration
3. Consider adding metrics collection for monitoring
4. Evaluate if any legacy server implementations can be fully removed
